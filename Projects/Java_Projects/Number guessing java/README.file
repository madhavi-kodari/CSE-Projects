Number Guessing Game in Java

This project is a simple implementation of a number guessing game in Java.
The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess the number.
After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. The user can keep playing as many times as they want.

## Features
---------------
- Random number generation between 1 and 100.
- User input is prompted to guess the number.
- Feedback after each guess whether the input is too high or too low.
- Tracks the number of attempts it takes the player to guess the correct number.
- Allows the user to play multiple rounds by asking if they want to play again after correctly guessing the number.

## Technologies Used
---------------------
- Java

## Requirements
--------------
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your machine.
- A terminal or IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) to run Java programs.
