Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java.
It allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.
The game checks for a winner after every move and announces the winner when one player gets three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Features
--------------
- Two players take turns placing their marks ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 board.
- The game checks for a win condition after every move:
  - Three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
- The board is printed after every move, showing the current state.
- If a player attempts to place a mark on an already occupied cell, they are prompted to try again.
- The game ends when a player wins.

## Technologies Used

- Java

## Requirements

- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your machine.
- A terminal or IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) to run Java programs.
