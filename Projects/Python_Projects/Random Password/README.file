Password Generator in Python

This project is a simple Python script that generates a random password of the specified length. 
The password includes a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation characters to ensure strength and security.

## Features
------------
- Generates a random password with a specified length.
- The password is composed of:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Digits (0-9)
  - Punctuation characters (e.g., !, @, #, $, etc.)
- Customizable password length input by the user.
- Secure and strong password generation.

## Technologies Used
---------------------
- Python 3.x
- `random` and `string` libraries for password generation

## Requirements
---------------
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

## Example Interaction
--------------------------
Enter the Length the Password: 12
Your password is: 3d@q!X9h#j&Z

## How It Works
------------------
- The script uses the `string` module to get a pool of characters that includes:
  - `string.ascii_letters` for all uppercase and lowercase letters.
  - `string.digits` for numbers 0-9.
  - `string.punctuation` for special characters like `!`, `@`, `#`, etc.
- The password length is provided by the user input, and the password is generated by randomly choosing characters from this pool.
